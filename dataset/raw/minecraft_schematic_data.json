Intended to be used with a looting sword for max drops but there is an AFK platform if you would rather that. I have build this entire farm in survival and tested that it's working.\n\r\nFor Java, built in 1.20.4. \n\r\nImportant Notes:\r\n- Make sure you build this above bedrock. Your Y level should be 154 when standing on the shroomlight platform at the bottom and the schematic should be at Y 153\r\n- To change between using looting and using the AFK platform, press the button to the right of the mob drop platform (where the red sand is)\r\n- Build this in nether wastes, above a lava lake. If mobs are still spawning below the bedrock when you're using the AFK platform, you will need to remove the areas they are spawning in to ensure highest mob rates\r\n- If you plan to make a barter farm, find a nether wastes near a crimson forest as barter farms need to be in a crimson forest.\r\n- The grindstones can be facing up or down but not side to side as piglins will get stuck on them otherwise.\r\n- The auto-crafting system can be built layer by layer as per the schematic, but ensure the back 3 crafters have all of their slots selected. This ensures that the target blocks are powered in front of them.\r\n- Ensure the top hopper of the auto sorting system has overflow protection: 41 gold nuggets/ingots in the first slot and 1 named item in the other 4 slots. 7 of the first hoppers should be for nuggets and the last 3 for gold ingots.\r\n- You can build the gold farm layer by layer, but you will need to follow gnembon's guide in the video linked above for placing the hopper minecarts. It looks way more intimidating than it is, but it's pretty forgiving. Skip to 28:15 for the specific part.\r\n- For your own sanity, wear frost walker boots when doing the magma block layers. It stops you from taking damage.", "Category": "Redstone", "Theme": "Other", "Size": "Large", "File Format": ".litematic", "Submitted by": "thundercuck9000", "Posted on": "April 9th, 2024 10:15 AM EST", "Download(s)": "Has been downloaded 2402 times"}, "21504": {"title": "Cannon event music", "description": "Spiderman cannon event with note blocks. perfect for memes", "Category": "Redstone", "Theme": "Other", "Size": "Small", "File Format": ".schem", "Submitted by": "SourCarcass31", "Posted on": "April 16th, 2024 02:58 PM EST", "Download(s)": "Has been downloaded 680 times"}, "531": {"title": "Nether Wart Farm", "description": "Eine kleine Warzen Farm habe die so kompakt wie m\u00f6glich gebaut.\r\nSchaut es euch mal an.

Para lograr esto, he construido una granja que usa un mecanismo de eliminaci\u00f3n de Enderman llamado \"fall damage\", es decir, los Enderman caen desde una altura elevada haciendo mas facil matarlos.\n\r\nAdem\u00e1s, mi granja tambi\u00e9n cuenta con una \"sala de recolecci\u00f3n\" dise\u00f1ada para recolectar autom\u00e1ticamente las Enderperls. La sala de recolecci\u00f3n est\u00e1 construida debajo del \u00e1rea de eliminaci\u00f3n y utiliza un sistema de hoppers para recoger las Enderperls que caen. Esta sala de recolecci\u00f3n es muy \u00fatil para recoger grandes cantidades de Enderperls de manera eficiente y sin tener que estar constantemente pendiente de ellas.\n\r\nEn resumen, mi granja de Enderperls es muy eficiente y funciona bien en servidores con lag y mob-spawning limitado. Su mecanismo de eliminaci\u00f3n de Enderman por \"fall damage\" y la sala de recolecci\u00f3n autom\u00e1tica hacen que sea una granja muy eficiente y f\u00e1cil de usar para recolectar grandes cantidades de Enderperls. \u00a1Espero que esta descripci\u00f3n haya sido \u00fatil para ti y que puedas construir tu propia granja de Enderperls en tu mundo de Minecraft!\n\r\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | ENGLISH | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\r\nFirstly, an Enderpearl farm is a structure designed to collect Enderpearls from Endermen. These mobs spawn in the Nether and in the End, and can drop Enderpearls upon death. Enderpearls are a very useful item in Minecraft as they allow the player to teleport to any location within a certain range.\n\r\nMy Enderpearl farm is designed to work on servers with lag and limited mob-spawning, which means it focuses on efficiency and reducing server lag. To achieve this, I have built a farm that uses an Enderman elimination mechanism called \"fall damage\", where Endermen fall from a high height, making it easier to kill them.\n\r\nAdditionally, my farm also features a \"collection room\" designed to automatically collect Enderpearls. The collection room is built beneath the elimination area and uses a hopper system to collect the Enderpearls that fall. This collection room is very useful for efficiently collecting large quantities of Enderpearls without constantly having to monitor them.\n\r\nIn summary, my Enderpearl farm is very efficient and works well on servers with lag and limited mob-spawning. Its Enderman elimination mechanism by \"fall damage\" and automatic collection room make it a very efficient and easy-to-use farm for collecting large quantities of Enderpearls. I hope this description has been useful for you and that you can build your own Enderpearl farm in your Minecraft world!", "Category": "Redstone", "Theme": "Other", "Size": "Small", "File Format": ".litematic", "Submitted by": "AimbotO_o", "Posted on": "May 5th, 2023 10:23 AM EST", "Download(s)": "Has been downloaded 1255 times"}, "9266": {"title": "8-Bit randomizer", "description": "Description", "Category": "Redstone", "Theme": "Other", "Size": "Small", "File Format": ".schematic", "Submitted by": "RedstoneLamp", "Posted on": "April 15th, 2017 06:22 PM EST", "Download(s)": "Has been downloaded 115 times"}, "17517": {"title": "Creeper Farm", "description": "Creeper Farm 13000p/h ", "Category": "Redstone", "Theme": "Other", "Size": "Medium", "File Format": ".litematic", "Submitted by": "hvhlove", "Posted on": "February 16th, 2022 12:51 PM EST", "Download(s)": "Has been downloaded 2665 times"}, "19955": {"title": "Easy Automatic Cobblestone Farm by Shulkercraft", "description": "", "Category": "Redstone", "Theme": "Other", "Size": "Medium", "File Format": ".litematic", "Submitted by": "Julian_Konrad", "Posted on": "July 29th, 2023 08:39 AM EST", "Download(s)": "Has been downloaded 2297 times"}, "9169": {"title": "Beacon auto Night-Day", "description": "Description", "Category": "Redstone", "Theme": "Other", "Size": "Small", "File Format": ".schematic", "Submitted by": "Guadalia", "Posted on": "March 31st, 2017 09:28 AM EST", "Download(s)": "Has been downloaded 256 times"}, "17588": {"title": "Villager Breeder", "description": "", "Category": "Redstone", "Theme": "Other", "Size": "Medium", "File Format": ".litematic", "Submitted by": "rogue805", "Posted on": "March 7th, 2022 12:30 PM EST", "Download(s)": "Has been downloaded 3176 times"}, "19203": {"title": "Display first bulk storage", "description": "", "Category": "Redstone", "Theme": "Modern", "Size": "Medium", "File Format": ".litematic", "Submitted by": "dPixie", "Posted on": "March 18th, 2023 06:21 AM EST", "Download(s)": "Has been downloaded 318 times"}, "16505": {"title": "Mechanical fireplace", "description": "Mechanical fireplace", "Category": "Redstone", "Theme": "Other", "Size": "Small", "File Format": ".schem", "Submitted by": "MishaZaetstop", "Posted on": "May 29th, 2021 09:48 AM EST", "Download(s)": "Has been downloaded 176 times"}, "229": {"title": "HELLO Sign", "description": "Simply, a HELLO sign.

start the timers, these are what enables the fuel and stuff to be pushed up to feed the carts), also you'll need to place 2 chest carts on each of the starting positions at the top (you'll see through the glass), (reason for this is that schematics dont save stuff in hoppers/chests or things like carts, just blocks), these would only need to be done once\n\r\nwhen you go in the door, place fuel in

Los Pigman son atra\u00eddos hacia el mu\u00f1eco de nieve, que les hace saltar hacia el centro de la plataforma y caer a una altura suficiente para provocar su propia muerte.\n\r\nUna vez que los Pigman han ca\u00eddo, sus objetos se recogen autom\u00e1ticamente utilizando un sistema de agua y canales que los llevan a un punto central donde se pueden recolectar y almacenar.\n\r\nLa granja de oro Fahrenheit es una gran opci\u00f3n para aquellos jugadores que buscan una fuente constante de oro en Minecraft.

These portals are located in a specific area at the right coordinates, ensuring that Pigmen appear constantly.\n\r\nThe next step is to build a platform around the portals, on which a snow golem can be placed. Pigmen are attracted to the snow golem, which makes them jump towards the center of the platform and fall to a sufficient height to cause their own death.\n\r\nOnce the Pigmen have fallen, their items are automatically collected using a system of water and channels that lead them to a central point where they can be collected and stored.\n\r\nThe Fahrenheit gold farm is a great option for players looking for a constant source of gold in Minecraft.

There is a \"reset\" feature - as you leave the station it deselects the track back to default.

This takes the full day-and-night cycle of Minecraft into account: Since grass spreads slower at night (even with light sources around) the farm runs slower which reduces the average rate. If you sleep through the nights, the rate goes up to 1200 wool per color per hour for a total of 19,200 wool per hour.\r\nNote: Those numbers were obtained using gnembon's Carpet Mod in a creative singleplayer world that contains only the sheep farm. Therefore, those rates were determined under optimal conditions. Especially on SMP servers your mileage may vary: I built this farm on the PMC 10 Year Anniversary Server and get around 700 wool per color and hour.\n\r\nA little bit of efficiency was sacrificed for a more compact and easy to use farm. Unfortunately, this also increased the material cost from one observer to two observers per sheep. In the world download I have included an example for a sheep holding cell that only uses one observer which makes the build less expensive but also less compact and it uses redstone dust, which I personally try to avoid if possible.\n\r\nThe download includes schematics for the full farm as well as a single farm cell and a 16 sheep array.

The original schematic was done by Trippel2511. See that one here: https://www.minecraft-schematics.com/schematic/12066/\n\r\nThere were some problems with this original design, that being there was loss of items to the lava. This is fixed by using a hopper minecart just below the slab that the baby chickens stand on. You can still use the original design with just a hopper, but you may lose quite a bit of items to the lava. This is because the hopper minecart will pick up items faster than a hopper alone.\n\r\nI also did not like that the farm was surrounded by solid blocks and couldn't see into the farm. I changed this to white stained glass, but you can change those glass blocks to anything (solid or transparent). Only the stone and cyan concrete must stay as solid blocks due to the redstone.\n\r\nThis farm works by having adult chickens standing above hoppers laying eggs into a dispenser that will shoot out eggs onto a slab producing baby chickens. The baby chickens are just short enough to avoid being killed by the lava. When they turn into adults, they hit the lava and die, producing cooked chicken and feathers.\n\nYou will also need a hopper minecart in this design (it is not included in the material list since it counts as an entity but will appear on the schematic)\n\r\nIf you are building this in survival, here is a complete list of all required raw materials:\n\r\nTotal iron needed: 33\r\nTotal redstone needed: 10\r\nTotal wood logs needed: 18\n\r\n2 repeaters\r\n1 comparator\r\n5 hoppers\r\n1 minecart\r\n1 dispenser\r\n1 bucket of lava\r\n1 chest\r\n1 slab (any type)\r\n6 redstone\r\n33 building blocks (any type)\r\n10 building blocks (must be solid)\r\nMany chickens\n\r\nThanks and enjoy!", "Category": "Redstone", "Theme": "Other", "Size": "Small", "File Format": ".litematic", "Submitted by": "Kairinezz", "Posted on": "November 22nd, 2021 09:09 PM EST", "Download(s)": "Has been downloaded 4480 times"}, "12399": {"title": "x4 XP Machine", "description": "Just fill with XP bottles!
