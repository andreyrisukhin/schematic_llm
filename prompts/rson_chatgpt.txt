The following is an RSON schematic of a Minecraft redstone piston door. Your task is to extend it to be a 2x3, that is to add a third layer of pistons. Read the schematic, and output your own schematic in the same RSON format:

### Key Modifications:
1. **Added a third row of pistons**: There are now six pistons in total—three sticky pistons on each side.
2. **Expanded the door to 2x3**: Added more stone blocks to complete the 2x3 door, filling the additional space.
3. **Extended the redstone wiring**: Adjusted the redstone dust and quartz blocks to connect the new pistons, ensuring that the entire mechanism functions correctly.
4. **Moved the lever**: Positioned the lever appropriately to control the new redstone layout.

This schematic should work for a 2x3 piston door!
