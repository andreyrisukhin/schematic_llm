The following is an RSON schematic of a Minecraft redstone piston door. RSON schematics have metadata (a name and description of the schematic behavior), and a list of key blocks that are required to be a valid redstone circuit. 

Key blocks are organized by functional group, such as the door blocks (which must be move out of the volume they occupy and back in to be a valid door), the pistons required to move those blocks, the redstone to activate those pistons, and the lever to activate the circuit. RSON defines that blocks not listed are air blocks. RSON is not valid if two blocks have duplicate coordinates (x, y, z), because the same space cannot be occupied by two blocks.

Note that this RSON schematic is for a door with dimensions 2x2, meaning there are four door blocks to remove when activated. Your task is to extend the door volume to be a 2x3, that is to add a third layer of pistons allowing a user to remove and replace a 2x3 volume of blocks with a lever. 

Read the schematic, and output your own updated schematic in the same RSON format:
